SpiderSense
===========

Use this plugin to determine if a request is from a spider or not. Can be useful in avoiding expensive operations. 


Example
=======

class AwesomeController < ActionController::Base
  
  def index
    if is_spider?
      # Do really cool but expensive stuff
    else
      # just render the stock page for indexing by the spider
    end
  end
end
